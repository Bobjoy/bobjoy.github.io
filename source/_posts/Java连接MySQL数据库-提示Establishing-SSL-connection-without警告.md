# 问题描述

Java在连接MySQL数据库时，输出如下警告信息

```
Tue Jul 11 18:04:07 CST 2017 WARN: Establishing SSL connection without server's identity verification is not recommended. According to MySQL 5.5.45+, 5.6.26+ and 5.7.6+ requirements SSL connection must be established by default if explicit option isn't set. For compliance with existing applications not using SSL the verifyServerCertificate property is set to 'false'. You need either to explicitly disable SSL by setting useSSL=false, or set useSSL=true and provide truststore for server certificate verification.

# 解决办法

1. 在jdbc连接后添加 `useSSL=false` 参数

```properties
url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/es?autoReconnect=true&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&useSSL=false
```

2. 如果以上办法无效，则需要替换 `mysql-connector-java` 依赖版本为 5.1.38 以下，如下

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.37</version>
</dependency>
```
